## NYC Vaccination Efforts by SWE

    This article details the efforts of software engineers who quickly created  websites to make it easier for NYC residents to sign up for vaccination for COVID. Many in the tech community believed that the city's handling of the vaccination was completely inadequate with official websites being unresponsive and very opaque for users especially those who don't work with technology too often. And so many developers decided to take matters into their own hands. John Ma created TurboVax which is website which details the latest information on vaccine availability in all of NYC's vaccination center's and even tweets real-time of vaccine availability. Another positive effort is NYC Vaccine List that connects all the information of available vaccines and sends it to community organizations so that marginalized communities such as the elderly can access it.
